    "Next up, we set the learning rate scheduler. A learning rate scheduler dynamically alters the learning rate whilst the model is training. We'll be using the one cycle learning rate scheduler, however [many](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate) schedulers are available in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one cycle learning rate scheduler starts with a small initial learning rate which is gradually increased to a maximum value - the value found by our learning rate finder - it then slowly decreases the learning rate to a final value smaller than the initial learning rate. This learning rate is updated after every parameter update step, i.e. after every training batch. For our model, the learning rate for the final `fc` layer throughout training will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./../assets/lr-scheduler.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, it starts at slightly less than $1x10^{-4}$ before gradually increasing to the maximum value of $1x10^{-3}$ at around a third of the way through training, then it begins decreasing to almost zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different parameter groups defined by the optimizer for the discriminative fine-tuning will all have their own learning rate curves, each with different starting and maximum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis is that the initial stage where the learning rate increases is a \"warm-up\" phase is used to get the model into a generally good area of the loss landscape. The middle of the curve, where the learning rate is at maximum is supposedly good for acting as a regularization method and prevents the model from overfitting or becoming stuck in saddle points. Finally, the \"cool-down\" phase, where the learning rate decreases, is used to reach small crevices in the loss surface which have a lower loss value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one cycle learning rate also cycles the momentum of the optimizer. The momentum is cycled from a maximum value, down to a minimum and then back up to the maximum where it is held constant for the last few steps. The default maximum and minimum values of momentum used by PyTorch's one cycle learning rate scheduler should be sufficient and we will not change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set-up the one cycle learning rate scheduler we need the total number of steps that will occur during training. We simply get this by multiplying the number of epochs with the number of batches in the training iterator, i.e. number of parameter updates. We get the maximum learning rate for each parameter group and pass this to `max_lr`. **Note:** if you only pass a single learning rate and not a list of learning rates then the scheduler will assume this learning rate should be used for all parameters and will **not** do discriminative fine-tuning."
