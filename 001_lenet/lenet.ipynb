    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be implementing a modified version of [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), a neural network model that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) layers and was designed for [classifying handwritten characters](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf). CNNs are ubiquitous in modern computer vision. Almost every neural network model for computer vision contains many CNN layers, also referred to as convolutional layers, thus they're an important concept to understand. We will explain how they work when we implement the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the architecture of LeNet-5. It consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by a subsampling layer, and then three fully connected linear layers.\n",

    "### Defining the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The LeNet architectures, and almost every modern neural network computer vision architecture, makes use of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is a CNN layer? Each convolutional layer has a number of *filters*, also commonly referred to as *kernels*. A filter is a (usually) square matrix that slides across the pixels in an image from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. At each \"step\", the filter performs a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) operation on the image. The output of the convolutional layer is the result of these convolutions after the filter's final \"step\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** in machine learning frameworks there aren't actually \"steps\", the result for every filter location is calculated at the same time, in parallel. This is a lot faster than actually stepping through the image, but thinking about it in terms of steps makes everything easier to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at a single 2x2 filter passing over an image. We'll pretend the image is 10x10 pixels in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/assets/filter-mnist.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter (red) slides over the pixels of the image, stepping one pixel at a time. The size of the steps is called the *stride*, and we use a stride of one in this implementation, which means the filter moves one pixel at a time horizontally and moves one pixel down once it reaches the end of a row. The result of the convolution operation (green) is a pixel in the filtered image. All of these convolutions produce a new, filtered image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the image coming out of the CNN layer is smaller than the image coming into the CNN. This is because the 2x2 filter has only nine steps horizontally and vertically. If we wanted to keep the output image the same size as the input image, we could add padding - usually black pixels - around our image. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we have no padding and a step size of one, the size of the output image is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{height}_{\\text{out}} = \\text{height}_{\\text{in}} - \\text{filter}_{\\text{height}} + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{width}_{\\text{out}} = \\text{width}_{\\text{in}} - \\text{filter}_{\\text{width}} + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we calculate the values of the output pixels using the filter? It's simply multiplying and adding! Each of the input image pixels covered by a filter is multiplied by the filter's weight over that pixel. All of these products are then summed together to get the value of the pixel in the output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/assets/single-filter.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The same weights are used by the filter over the whole image. The weights do not change depending on the filter's location within the image. One nice thing about this is that the filters (and the convolutional layers themselves) are *translation invariant*, that means it doesn't matter where a feature (curve, edge, line) appears in an image, the convolutional layer will find all occurrences of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weights for the filters, much like the weights of the linear layers in multilayer perceptrons, are learned via gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are convolutional neural networks structured in this way? Filters applied across an image in this way can be used to detect patterns such as horizontal and vertical lines within an image. These patterns can be thought of as features of the image, which our CNN extracts. These extracted features can then be combined in further layers of the neural network with other extracted features and together create higher level features, e.g. a certain position and orientation of two lines to make a cross, which can indicate the centre of a handwritten 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are also inspired by classic computer vision techniques, like [Sobel filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator). Let's try manually choosing weights of a 3x3 filter to make Sobel filters and apply them to some MNIST digits to see what type of things our CNN layers can learn.\n",

We're also not going to use the Gaussian connections at the end, instead we'll just use a standard linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer in our model is a convolutional layer with 6 filters (PyTorch calls them `out_channels`) and a kernel size of 5. This turns our `[1, 28, 28]` image into `[6, 24, 24]`. We then downsample our image with a max pooling layer that has a filter size of 2 to get a `[6, 12, 12]` image. This is then passed through an activation function, ReLU in this case, which is applied elementwise and does not change the of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we pass the image to the second convolutional layer with 16 filters that are 5x5x6, a height and width of 5 and a depth of 6 as our previous convolutional layer had 6 filters. This gives us an image size of `[16, 8, 8]` which we then max pool to half the height and width to `[16, 4, 4]` and then pass through another ReLU function.\n",

    "We then flatten our `[16, 4, 4]` image to `[256]` and pass this through three linear layers. Each of the linear layers are followed by another ReLU, except for the last.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that you should always apply your activation function **after** the pooling layer. You will get the exact same results if you apply the activation function before, however this means you will be applying your activation function to a larger number of inputs, increasing the computation required. Using the activation function after the image has been reduced in size means it will be applied to fewer inputs and thus use less computation."
